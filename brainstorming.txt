Setting: Earth 23XX

Conditions:
Humanity seperated by secret society in the sky and those on Earth. The people of earth are intelligent and advance. 

Society was seperated at one point.(What cause humanity to seperte and live in the sky?) those iving above where visible for many years although they did not communicate with those living on the surface. 

AI was the reason that humanity was divided. The AI was created and activated. It has plans for humanity but not all of humaity agrees with the AI plans. This leads to a division and the AI decides and instructs it's human followers to exodus from earth leaving the humans that dont want to follow its plan alone. 

One day all of a sudden the sky dwelllers were gone, no where to be seen. Earth dwelllers tried its best to find out where the sky dwellers went. 

Before ther divide there was a special weapons program that created mechas. These were made with the most advance and finite technology at the time. The mechas were left behind incase there were a need by a returning skydweller. This was thought to be safe since they required cryptographic keys to activate them, and those were safely kept by a high ranking skydweller. 

The activation keys gets acquired by an under cover agent. They are the daughter of the agent that orginally came with the goal to get gather information of what the skydweller society has been up to.
